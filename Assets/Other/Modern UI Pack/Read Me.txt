The boy in city 1 goes everywhere
the final crossing the car can run over the people 







Chameleon
John Collins-> the use of generative AI, is not good enough to demonstrate technical competence. => Probably a pass
Md Mobasshe Nomani 222499162=> no contribution through the entire trimester. NP


Gloria Chem Kiplagat - P student. Join late, 3.1 test-> missing pull request (did it late), pull request was done by someone else???, so some of the pull request is her own work some is someone else. There is chat inquiry on Final Individual Retrospective. GitHub is public...(So likely the other person has the access to the GitHub at the moment).



Ross Parkinson -> pulling his weight pretty good for both technical and team level. All off his tasks late, but his contribution are really good. He just does not care about task submission at all. Discuss this with Atabak. At the moment he is in low distinction because of his good contribution and leadership.

Alex-> has not submit his portfolio. So it's 7 days late so far.
